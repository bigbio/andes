"""Build a 1:1 SHUFFLED entrapment database — the design behind the published glyco numbers.

    build_shuffled_entrap.py <targets.fasta> <out.fasta> [seed]

For every target sequence this appends a companion whose amino-acid composition and length
are identical but whose order is shuffled, tagged `ENTRAP_` inside the accession AND the
entry name (`>sp|ENTRAP_Q99JY4|ENTRAP_TRABD_MOUSE`), which is the layout `eval_entrap.py`
detects by substring.

WHY SHUFFLED-SELF RATHER THAN A FOREIGN PROTEOME
`build_entrap.py` in this directory does something different: it appends an unrelated
proteome (yeast / E. coli). Both are valid entrapment designs, but they are NOT
interchangeable for glyco, and mixing them is why an independent reproduction of the mouse
benchmark came out ~21% high:

  * Ratio. Shuffled-self is exactly 1:1, so the FDP correction factor is 2. A foreign
    proteome is whatever size it happens to be — mouse + E. coli reviewed is about 3.9:1,
    needing a factor near 4.9, and no one is reminded of that by the file name.
  * Sequon density. Only peptides carrying an N-X-S/T sequon can be glycopeptides, so the
    entrapment space that matters is sequon-bearing peptides, not all peptides. Shuffling
    preserves composition, so sequon density tracks the target closely. A foreign proteome
    does not, which forces a large and easily-forgotten sequon correction.
  * Search-space size. A smaller database yields fewer candidates and fewer decoys, which
    moves the q-value threshold and therefore the count — independently of any real change
    in engine behaviour.

Use this script to reproduce the published mouse and plasma glyco numbers. Use
`build_entrap.py` when you deliberately want foreign-proteome entrapment, and then size the
correction factor from the database you actually built rather than assuming 1:1.
